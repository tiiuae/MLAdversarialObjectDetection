Purpose: Adversarial patch addition to persons based on bounding box. This adds adversarial patch to an image.
It uses numpy and opencv and is executed on the CPU. This class is suited for inference time and should only be used
for that. During training the attacker module already implements everything in this class inside a tf graph which can be
placed on the GPU and can execute much faster during training
